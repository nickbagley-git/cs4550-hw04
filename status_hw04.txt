All functionality

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?

Yes but it took forever to figure out

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?

Fairly comfortable with the coding syntax but still not 
comfortable at all with the server side stuff.

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?

On the coding side I had the most trouble getting the calculator to 
work because it has been a while since i programmed functionally and 
had to call recursive functions. Overall the most difficult part was 
getting the site to remain online when I exit the deploy script.
